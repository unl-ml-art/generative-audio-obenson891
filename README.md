# Project 2 Generative Audio

Olivia Benson obenson2@huskers.unl.edu 


## Abstract

With limited knowledge of music at all, my ideas include using completion to finish popular internet sounds, such as tiktok sounds, vine sounds etc. My other idea would be to work with voice clones/vocaloids but I am unsure of the limitations and software we have available for this project. 

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
